## Project Overview  
Weâ€™ll build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas! Check out this example:

You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece! Your users should be able to:   
1.  Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2.  Choose a color.
3.  Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.  

Your primary task is to implement the `makeGrid()` function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.  
In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills including:

*   Defining variables with `const` and `let`
*   Accessing the DOM using methods of the `document` object
*   Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
*   Writing nested loops and using loop variables
